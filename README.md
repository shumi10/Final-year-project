# Final Year Project (ongoing) (updated last on 03-Jan-2023)

###### The goal of this project is to determine how political elites in Pakistan use social media as a source to amplify their narratives and agendas using misinformation. I have used the Twitter API to extract tweets of 32 politicians. These politicians belong to the following two political parties, i.e., Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and Pakistan Muslim League N (PMLN). These tweets (Twitter data) have been extracted in the period spanning from 01/May/2022 (5:00 am UTC) to 23/August/2022 (11:00 pm UTC). A sample of two such politicians’ tweets has been shared (Imran Khan - Founder and Leader of PTI, and Shehbaz Sharif - Leader of the PMLN party).  

###### Once these tweets are collected, I have sampled the tweets into three categories (top 10%, average 10%, bottom 10%) based on twitter engagement rates (likes/replies/retweets). Those tweets are saved as an output excel file for each politician. To verify the claims in these tweets, I have initially fact-checked the tweets against local fact checking sources. I used sochfactcheck and AFP Pakistan alongside google fact-check scholar. The reason for this exhaustive process was to get a labeled data set. 

###### I have currently working on the classification of the twitter URLs shared by these political elites. This will help us determine the main source of mainstream media or other information channels that is commonly used by these elites to support their false narratives and gain more influence.  

###### My next steps include formulating research questions on the data at hand and doing statistical analysis of the data to answer these questions. This involves finding causal inferences on the data and discovering meaningful relationships between features.

###### The project aims to determine which political party is more involved in spreading fake news based on URLs, retweets, and tweets.
